## Project Dependencies

- Java

## Objectives

1. Know basics of programming (such as if-else, loop).
2. Be able to implement a complicate visualization system.

## Ideas

- This problem is not hard but complicate. It will be easier if I use other programming languages. But I decide to use Java because I want to use it.
- First, create a 5x5 number pattern.
- Then, form a canvas for placing each character.
- Next, calculated the place carefully.
- Finally, publish the canvas that contains the result.
